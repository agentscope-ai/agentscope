# AgentScope-easy: Developer-First Multi-Agent Framework

<p align="center">
  <strong>Fork Notice</strong><br/>
  Thanks to the original authors and community of AgentScope — upstream:
  <a href="https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope">agentscope-ai/agentscope</a>.
  <br/>
  AgentScope-easy is a streamlined variant branched from the AgentScope ecosystem.
  This repository is developed on the <code>easy</code> branch, offering several unique additions while maintaining compatibility with the core AgentScope framework.

## 🚀 Why AgentScope-easy?

**Easy for beginners, powerful for experts** — AgentScope-easy provides a developer-centric approach to multi-agent application development.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

### Transparency First
- **Everything Visible**: Prompt engineering, API invocation, agent building, workflow orchestration — all are visible and controllable for developers.
- **No Deep Encapsulation Magic**: Reject implicit logic and black-box patterns.

### Architectural Excellence
- **Asynchronous Native**: Full embrace of async/await patterns for realtime responsiveness.
- **Multi-Agent Oriented**: Explicit message passing and workflow orchestration designed specifically for multi-agent scenarios.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ⚡ Real-Time Steering
Native support for interruption handling with robust memory preservation.

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Agentic Tools Management**: Tools that can manage other tools dynamically.
- **LEGO-Style Composition**: Every component is modular and independent, enabling flexible agent construction.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Installation

#### From Source (recommended)
```bash
git clone -b easy https://github.com/charSLee013/agentscope-easy.git
cd agentscope-easy
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Hello AgentScope-easy!

```python
import asyncio
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.model import OpenAIChatModel
from agentscope.formatter import OpenAIChatFormatter
from agentscope.memory import InMemoryMemory
from agentscope.message import Msg

async def main():
    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="Friday",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Friday.",
        model=OpenAIChatModel(model_name="gpt-4o", stream=True),
        formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    )

    # single round
    reply = await agent(Msg("user", "Hello!", "user"))
    print(reply.get_text_content())

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 💡 Advanced Features

### Real-Time Steering
Native interruption support allows for dynamic conversation control without losing context.

### Multi-Agent Conversation

AgentScope-easy provides comprehensive support for complex multi-agent workflows.

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

AgentScope-easy follows a **modular, composable architecture** with clear separation between framework scaffolding and business logic.
