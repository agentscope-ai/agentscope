Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.

    PythonAgent: Here is a simple implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python. This function sorts an array in-place.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        else:
            pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
            left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
            middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
            right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
            return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
    ```

    If you want to sort the array in place, here's another version that does not use additional space for `left`, `middle`, and `right` lists:

    ```python
    def quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, pi + 1, high)


    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]
        i = low - 1
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
        return i + 1
    ```

    Let me know if you need an explanation or have any specific requirements for the quicksort implementation.

    Router: The quick sort function in Python has been generated. There are two versions provided: the first one is a simple implementation that does not sort the array in place, and the second version sorts the array in place without using additional space for `left`, `middle`, and `right` lists.

    Here's the in-place version of the quick sort function:

    ```python
    def quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, pi + 1, high)

    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]
        i = low - 1
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
        return i + 1
    ```

    To use it, you can call `quick_sort_in_place` with your list and the indices for the start (low) and end (high) of the portion of the list you want to sort, like so:

    ```python
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    quick_sort_in_place(arr, 0, n-1)
    print("Sorted array is:", arr)
    ```

    If you need any further assistance or have specific requirements, feel free to let me know!
    Router: The quicksort function has been created for you. Here's how you can use the in-place version of the quicksort algorithm in Python:

    ```python
    def quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, high):
        # Implementation details as provided above

    def partition(arr, low, high):
        # Implementation details as provided above

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    quick_sort_in_place(arr, 0, n-1)
    print('Sorted array is:', arr)
    ```

    You can now use this code to sort an array. If you need more help or have other questions, please let me know!
