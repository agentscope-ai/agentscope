Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

    PythonAgent: Here is a Python implementation of the quick sort algorithm. This function sorts a list in-place using the Lomuto partition scheme.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            # Partition the array
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        
            # Recursively sort elements before and after partition
            quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)


    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]  # Pivot
        i = low - 1  # Index of smaller element
        for j in range(low, high):
            # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1  # Increment index of smaller element
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # Swap elements at i and j
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]  # Swap pivot with the element at i+1
        return i + 1  # Return the partitioning index
    ```

    To use this quick sort function, you can call it with your list and the indices of the first and last elements, like so: `quick_sort(your_list, 0, len(your_list) - 1)`.
