Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

            toolkit=Toolkit(),
        )
        msg_res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))

        return ToolResponse(
            content=msg_res.get_content_blocks("text"),
        )


    # Fake some other tool functions for demonstration purposes

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.

    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)

    # Initialize the routing agent with the toolkit

    PythonAgent: Certainly! Below is a Python implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. This implementation uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is a common and straightforward approach.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        def _quick_sort(items, low, high):
            if low < high:
                # Partition the array and get the pivot index
                pi = partition(items, low, high)
                # Recursively sort the elements before and after partition
                _quick_sort(items, low, pi - 1)
                _quick_sort(items, pi + 1, high)

        def partition(items, low, high):
            # Choose the rightmost element as pivot
            pivot = items[high]
            i = low - 1
            for j in range(low, high):
                # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
                if items[j] <= pivot:
                    i += 1
                    # Swap elements at i and j
                    items[i], items[j] = items[j], items[i]
            # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
            items[i + 1], items[high] = items[high], items[i + 1]
            return i + 1

        # Call the helper function to start the quick sort
        _quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    1. **`quick_sort` Function**:
       - This is the main function that initializes the sorting process.
       - It calls the `_quick_sort` helper function with the initial indices (0 and `len(arr) - 1`).

    2. **`_quick_sort` Helper Function**:
       - This function recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
       - It first partitions the array and then recursively sorts the left and right sub-arrays.

    3. **`partition` Function**:
       - This function rearranges the elements in the array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
       - The pivot is chosen as the rightmost element of the sub-array.
       - It returns the index of the pivot after partitioning.

    ### Example Usage:
    - The example usage demonstrates how to sort an array using the `quick_sort` function.
    - The sorted array is printed to verify the result.

    This implementation is efficient and works well for most cases. However, for large datasets or specific use cases, you might want to consider other optimizations or variations of the Quick Sort algorithm.

    Router: The Python code for a quick sort function has been generated. Here it is:

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        def _quick_sort(items, low, high):
            if low < high:
                # Partition the array and get the pivot index
                pi = partition(items, low, high)
                # Recursively sort the elements before and after partition
                _quick_sort(items, low, pi - 1)
                _quick_sort(items, pi + 1, high)

        def partition(items, low, high):
            # Choose the rightmost element as pivot
            pivot = items[high]
            i = low - 1
            for j in range(low, high):
                # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
                if items[j] <= pivot:
                    i += 1
                    # Swap elements at i and j
                    items[i], items[j] = items[j], items[i]
            # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
            items[i + 1], items[high] = items[high], items[i + 1]
            return i + 1

        # Call the helper function to start the quick sort
        _quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```

    This implementation uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is a common and straightforward approach. It includes a main `quick_sort` function that initializes the sorting process, a `_quick_sort` helper function that recursively sorts the sub-arrays, and a `partition` function that rearranges the elements around a pivot.

    You can use this code to sort an array in your Python program.
