Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

            name="PythonAgent",
            sys_prompt="You're a Python expert, your target is to generate Python code based on the demand.",
            model=DashScopeChatModel(
                model_name="qwen-max",
                api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
                stream=False,

            toolkit=Toolkit(),
        )
        msg_res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))

        return ToolResponse(
            content=msg_res.get_content_blocks("text"),
        )


    # Fake some other tool functions for demonstration purposes

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-177

.. code-block:: Python


    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_poem)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(web_search)

    # Initialize the routing agent with the toolkit
    router_implicit = ReActAgent(
        name="Router",
        sys_prompt="You're a routing agent. Your target is to route the user query to the right follow-up task.",

            "user",
        )

        # Route the query
        await router_implicit(msg_user)


    asyncio.run(example_router_implicit())

            "demand": "a quick sort function"

    }
    PythonAgent: Certainly! Here's a Python implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm:

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        else:
            pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
            left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
            middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
            right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
            return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

    # Example usage:
    arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
    ```

    This implementation uses the Lomuto partition scheme and recursively sorts the sub-arrays. The `pivot` is chosen as the middle element of the array, and the elements are divided into three lists: `left` (elements less than the pivot), `middle` (elements equal to the pivot), and `right` (elements greater than the pivot). The function then recursively sorts the `left` and `right` lists and concatenates them with the `middle` list to produce the final sorted array.

    If you need an in-place version of Quick Sort, here it is:

    ```python
    def quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, pi + 1, high)

    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]
        i = low - 1
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] < pivot:
                i += 1
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
        return i + 1

    # Example usage:
    arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
    quick_sort_in_place(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```

    In this in-place version, the `partition` function rearranges the elements in the array such that all elements less than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right. The `quick_sort_in_place` function then recursively sorts the sub-arrays defined by the partition index.
    system: {
        "type": "tool_result",
        "id": "call_3510948091534da39c1464",

            }
        ]
    }
    Router: The Python code for a quick sort function has been generated. Here is the non-in-place version of the Quick Sort algorithm:

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        else:
            pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
            left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
            middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
            right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
            return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

    # Example usage:
    arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
    ```

    And here is the in-place version of the Quick Sort algorithm, which sorts the array without using additional space for the `left`, `middle`, and `right` lists:

    ```python
    def quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort_in_place(arr, pi + 1, high)

    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]
        i = low - 1
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] < pivot:
                i += 1
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
        return i + 1

    # Example usage:
    arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
    quick_sort_in_place(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```

    You can use either version depending on whether you want to avoid using extra space (in-place) or not. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance with the code, feel free to let me know!
