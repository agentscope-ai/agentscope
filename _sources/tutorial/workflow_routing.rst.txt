Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

        )
        msg_res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))

        return ToolResponse(
            content=msg_res.get_content_blocks("text"),
        )


    # Fake some other tool functions for demonstration purposes

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.

    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)

    # Initialize the routing agent with the toolkit
    router_implicit = ReActAgent(

    PythonAgent: Certainly! Below is a Python implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. This version uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is simpler to understand and implement compared to the Hoare partition scheme.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        def _quick_sort(items, low, high):
            if low < high:
                # Partition the array
                pi = partition(items, low, high)
                # Recursively sort elements before and after partition
                _quick_sort(items, low, pi - 1)
                _quick_sort(items, pi + 1, high)

        def partition(items, low, high):
            pivot = items[high]  # Choose the last element as the pivot
            i = low - 1  # Pointer for the greater element
            for j in range(low, high):
                # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
                if items[j] <= pivot:
                    i += 1  # Increment the pointer
                    items[i], items[j] = items[j], items[i]  # Swap
            # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
            items[i + 1], items[high] = items[high], items[i + 1]
            return i + 1

        # Initial call to the recursive function
        _quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)
        return arr

    # Example usage:
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        example_array = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
        print("Original array:", example_array)
        sorted_array = quick_sort(example_array)
        print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    1. **_quick_sort Function**: This is a recursive function that sorts the array. It takes the array, a starting index (`low`), and an ending index (`high`).
    2. **partition Function**: This function partitions the array by selecting the last element as the pivot. It then rearranges the elements such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right. The function returns the index of the pivot.
    3. **Initial Call**: The `quick_sort` function makes the initial call to `_quick_sort` with the full range of the array.

    ### Example Usage:
    - The example array `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]` is sorted using the `quick_sort` function.
    - The sorted array is printed to the console.

    Router: The Python code for a quick sort function has been generated. Here is the implementation:

                _quick_sort(items, low, pi - 1)
                _quick_sort(items, pi + 1, high)

        def partition(items, low, high):
            pivot = items[high]  # Choose the last element as the pivot
            i = low - 1  # Pointer for the greater element
            for j in range(low, high):

                if items[j] <= pivot:
                    i += 1  # Increment the pointer
                    items[i], items[j] = items[j], items[i]  # Swap
            # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
            items[i + 1], items[high] = items[high], items[i + 1]

        print("Original array:", example_array)
