Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

    - What is the main theme or subject you want to explore?
    - Do you have a preferred style (e.g., free verse, sonnet, haiku)?
    - Are there any specific words, phrases, or imagery you'd like included?
    - Who is the intended audience for this poem?

    With a bit more detail, I can provide more tailored and helpful suggestions as we work together on crafting your poem.

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-140

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

        Args:

        # An example demand agent
        python_agent = ReActAgent(
            name="PythonAgent",
            sys_prompt="You're a Python expert, your target is to generate Python code based on the demand.",

        return ToolResponse(
            content=msg_res.get_content_blocks("text"),
        )


    # Fake some other tool functions for demonstration purposes

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-177

.. code-block:: Python


    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_poem)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(web_search)

    # Initialize the routing agent with the toolkit
    router_implicit = ReActAgent(

        sys_prompt="You're a routing agent. Your target is to route the user query to the right follow-up task.",

    PythonAgent: Certainly! Below is a Python implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. This function sorts an array in-place and uses the Lomuto partition scheme for simplicity.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            # Partition the array
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        
            # Recursively sort the elements before and after partition
            quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)

    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]  # Choose the last element as the pivot
        i = low - 1  # Pointer for the greater element

        for j in range(low, high):
            # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1  # Increment the pointer
                # Swap elements at i and j
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

        # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
        return i + 1

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    quick_sort(arr, 0, n - 1)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    1. **`quick_sort` Function**:
       - This function takes an array `arr`, a starting index `low`, and an ending index `high`.
       - It recursively sorts the sub-arrays before and after the partition index `pi`.

    2. **`partition` Function**:
       - This function takes an array `arr`, a starting index `low`, and an ending index `high`.
       - It selects the last element as the pivot.
       - It rearranges the elements in the array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
       - It returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning.

    3. **Example Usage**:
       - An example array `arr` is defined and sorted using the `quick_sort` function.
       - The sorted array is then printed.

    This implementation is efficient and works well for most cases. However, for large datasets or specific use cases, you might want to consider more advanced partitioning schemes like the Hoare partition scheme or optimizations like tail recursion elimination.

    }
    Router: The Python code for a quick sort function has been generated. Here is the implementation:

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            # Partition the array
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        
            # Recursively sort the elements before and after partition
            quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)

    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]  # Choose the last element as the pivot
        i = low - 1  # Pointer for the greater element

        for j in range(low, high):
            # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1  # Increment the pointer
                # Swap elements at i and j
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

        # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
        return i + 1

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    quick_sort(arr, 0, n - 1)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```

    This code includes both the `quick_sort` and `partition` functions, which together implement the Quick Sort algorithm. It also provides an example of how to use these functions to sort an array.
