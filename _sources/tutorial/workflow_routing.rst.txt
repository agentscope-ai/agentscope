Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

        msg_res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))

        return ToolResponse(
            content=msg_res.get_content_blocks("text"),
        )


    # Fake some other tool functions for demonstration purposes

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-177

    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_poem)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(web_search)

    # Initialize the routing agent with the toolkit
    router_implicit = ReActAgent(
        name="Router",
        sys_prompt="You're a routing agent. Your target is to route the user query to the right follow-up task.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(

    async def example_router_implicit() -> None:

        msg_user = Msg(
            "user",
            "Help me to generate a quick sort function in Python",
            "user",
        )

        # Route the query
        await router_implicit(msg_user)

    Router: {
        "type": "tool_use",
        "name": "generate_python",
        "input": {
            "demand": "a quick sort function"
        },
        "id": "call_e3dc26267f8748058498c6"
    }
    PythonAgent: Here is a Python implementation of the quick sort algorithm. This function sorts an array in place using the Lomuto partition scheme.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            # Partition the array
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        
            # Recursively sort elements before and after partition
            quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)


    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]
        i = low - 1
        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
        return i + 1
    ```

    To use this function, you can call `quick_sort` with the array you want to sort and the indices of the first and last elements, like so:

    ```python
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    quick_sort(arr, 0, n-1)
    print("Sorted array is:", arr)
    ```
