Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-140

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

            name="PythonAgent",
            sys_prompt="You're a Python expert, your target is to generate Python code based on the demand.",

            toolkit=Toolkit(),
        )
        msg_res = await python_agent(Msg("user", demand, "user"))

        return ToolResponse(
            content=msg_res.get_content_blocks("text"),
        )


    # Fake some other tool functions for demonstration purposes
    async def generate_poem(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-177

    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_python)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(generate_poem)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(web_search)

    # Initialize the routing agent with the toolkit
    router_implicit = ReActAgent(
        name="Router",
        sys_prompt="You're a routing agent. Your target is to route the user query to the right follow-up task.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
            stream=False,
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),

    )

        )

        # Route the query
        await router_implicit(msg_user)


    asyncio.run(example_router_implicit())

    PythonAgent: Certainly! Here's a Python implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. This version uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is simpler to understand and implement:

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        def partition(low, high):
            pivot = arr[high]
            i = low - 1
            for j in range(low, high):
                if arr[j] <= pivot:
                    i += 1
                    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
            return i + 1

        def sort(low, high):
            if low < high:
                pi = partition(low, high)
                sort(low, pi - 1)
                sort(pi + 1, high)

        sort(0, len(arr) - 1)
        return arr

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    - **partition**: This function takes the last element as the pivot, places the pivot element at its correct position in the sorted array, and places all smaller elements to the left of the pivot and all greater elements to the right.
    - **sort**: This is a recursive function that sorts the sub-arrays formed by partitioning.
    - **quick_sort**: This is the main function that initializes the sorting process.

    ### Example Output:
    If you run the example provided, the output will be:
    ```
    Sorted array: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```

    This implementation is efficient and works well for most cases. If you need a more optimized version or have specific requirements, let me know!

    Router: The quick sort function in Python has been generated for you. Here it is:

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        def partition(low, high):
            pivot = arr[high]
            i = low - 1
            for j in range(low, high):
                if arr[j] <= pivot:
                    i += 1
                    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
            return i + 1

        def sort(low, high):
            if low < high:
                pi = partition(low, high)
                sort(low, pi - 1)
                sort(pi + 1, high)

        sort(0, len(arr) - 1)
        return arr

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
    ```

    This implementation of Quick Sort uses the Lomuto partition scheme. It selects the last element as the pivot and ensures that all elements less than the pivot are on its left and all elements greater are on its right. The `sort` function then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

    If you run the example provided, the output will be:
    ```
    Sorted array: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```
