A2A Agent
============================

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is an open standard protocol for enabling interoperable communication between different AI agents.

AgentScope provides support for the A2A protocol at two levels: obtaining Agent Card information and connecting to remote agents. The related APIs are as follows:

.. list-table:: A2A Related Classes
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Class
      - Description
    * - ``A2AAgent``
      - Agent class for communicating with remote A2A agents
    * - ``A2AChatFormatter``
      - Formatter for converting between AgentScope messages and A2A message/task formats
    * - ``AgentCardResolverBase``
      - Base class for Agent Card resolvers
    * - ``FileAgentCardResolver``
      - Resolver for loading Agent Cards from local JSON files
    * - ``WellKnownAgentCardResolver``
      - Resolver for fetching Agent Cards from the well-known path of a URL
    * - ``NacosAgentCardResolver``
      - Resolver for fetching Agent Cards from the Nacos Agent Registry

This section demonstrates how to create an ``A2AAgent`` and communicate with remote A2A agents.

.. note:: Note that A2A support is an **experimental feature** and may change in future versions. Due to limitations of the A2A protocol itself, ``A2AAgent`` cannot fully align with local agents like ``ReActAgent``, including:

 - Only supports chatbot scenarios, i.e., only supports conversations between one user and one agent (does not affect handoff/router usage patterns)
 - Does not support real-time interruption during conversations
 - Does not support agentic structured output
 - In the current implementation, messages received by the ``observe`` method are stored locally and sent to the remote agent together when the ``reply`` method is called. Therefore, if several ``observe`` calls are made without a subsequent ``reply`` call, those messages will not be seen by the remote agent

Obtaining Agent Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we need to obtain an Agent Card to connect to the corresponding agent. An Agent Card contains information such as the agent's name, description, capabilities, and connection details.

Manually Creating Agent Card
--------------------------------

If you know all the information of an Agent Card, you can directly create an Agent Card object from `a2a.types.AgentCard`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-78

.. code-block:: Python


    # Create an Agent Card object
    agent_card = AgentCard(
        name="Friday",  # Agent name
        description="A fun chatting companion",  # Agent description
        url="http://localhost:8000",  # Agent's RPC service URL
        version="1.0.0",  # Agent version
        capabilities=AgentCapabilities(  # Agent capability configuration
            push_notifications=False,
            state_transition_history=True,
            streaming=True,
        ),
        default_input_modes=["text/plain"],  # Supported input formats
        default_output_modes=["text/plain"],  # Supported output formats
        skills=[],  # Agent skill list
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-84

Fetching from Remote Services
--------------------------------
AgentScope also supports fetching from the standard path of remote services (well-known server).
Here's an example using ``WellKnownAgentCardResolver`` to fetch an Agent Card from the standard path of a remote service:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-97

.. code-block:: Python



    async def agent_card_from_well_known_website() -> AgentCard:
        """Example of fetching an Agent Card from the well-known path of a remote service."""
        # Create an Agent Card resolver
        resolver = WellKnownAgentCardResolver(
            base_url="http://localhost:8000",
        )
        # Fetch and return the Agent Card
        return await resolver.get_agent_card()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-120

Loading Agent Cards from Local Files
--------------------------------

The ``FileAgentCardResolver`` class supports loading Agent Cards from local JSON files, suitable for configuration file management scenarios.
An example of an Agent Card in JSON format is shown below:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: Example Agent Card JSON file content

    {
        "name": "RemoteAgent",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000",
        "description": "Remote A2A Agent",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "capabilities": {},
        "default_input_modes": ["text/plain"],
        "default_output_modes": ["text/plain"],
        "skills": []
    }

You can easily load this file using ``FileAgentCardResolver``:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 120-134

.. code-block:: Python



    async def agent_card_from_file() -> AgentCard:
        """Example of loading an Agent Card from a local JSON file."""
        from agentscope.a2a import FileAgentCardResolver

        # Load Agent Card from JSON file
        resolver = FileAgentCardResolver(
            file_path="./agent_card.json",  # JSON file path
        )
        # Fetch and return the Agent Card
        return await resolver.get_agent_card()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 135-142

Fetching Agent Cards from Nacos Registry
--------------------------------

Nacos is an open-source dynamic service discovery, configuration management, and service management platform. In version 3.1.0, it introduced the Agent Registry feature, supporting distributed registration, discovery, and version management of A2A agents.

.. important:: The prerequisite for using ``NacosAgentCardResolver`` is that the user has deployed a Nacos server version 3.1.0 or higher. For deployment and registration procedures, please refer to the `official documentation <https://nacos.io/docs/latest/quickstart/quick-start>`_.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 142-159

.. code-block:: Python



    async def agent_card_from_nacos() -> AgentCard:
        """Example of fetching an Agent Card from the Nacos registry."""

        # Create a Nacos Agent Card resolver
        resolver = NacosAgentCardResolver(
            remote_agent_name="my-remote-agent",  # Agent name registered in Nacos
            nacos_client_config=ClientConfig(
                server_addresses="http://localhost:8848",  # Nacos server address
                # Other optional configuration items
            ),
        )
        # Fetch and return the Agent Card
        return await resolver.get_agent_card()

Building an A2A Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``A2AAgent`` class provided by AgentScope is used to communicate with remote A2A agents, and its usage is similar to regular agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 164-167

.. code-block:: Python


    agent = A2AAgent(agent_card=agent_card)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 168-176

Using ``A2AAgent``, developers can build chatbot scenario conversations, or encapsulate it as a tool function to build more complex application scenarios such as handoff/router.
Currently, the format protocol conversion supported by ``A2AAgent`` is handled by ``agentscope.formatter.A2AChatFormatter``, which supports:

- Converting AgentScope's ``Msg`` messages to A2A protocol's ``Message`` format
- Converting A2A protocol responses back to AgentScope's ``Msg`` format
- Converting A2A protocol's ``Task`` responses to AgentScope's ``Msg`` format
- Supporting multiple content types such as text, images, audio, and video


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 176-191

.. code-block:: Python



    async def a2a_in_chatbot() -> None:
        """Example of chatting using A2AAgent."""

        user = UserAgent("user")

        msg = None
        while True:
            msg = await user(msg)
            if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
                break
            msg = await agent(msg)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 192-193

Or encapsulate it as a tool function for invocation:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 193-213

.. code-block:: Python



    async def create_worker(query: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Complete a given task through a sub-agent

        Args:
            query (`str`):
                Description of the task to be completed by the sub-agent
        """
        res = await agent(
            Msg("user", query, "user"),
        )
        return ToolResponse(
            content=[
                TextBlock(
                    type="text",
                    text=res.get_text_content(),
                ),
            ],
        )
