Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. As the affirmative side, I will argue that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around the circumference of circle B without sliding, it will revolve 4 times in total by the time it returns to its starting point.

    To understand this, let's denote the radius of circle B as R and the radius of circle A as r. Given that r = R/3, we can calculate the circumferences of both circles. The circumference of circle B is 2πR, and the circumference of circle A is 2πr or 2π(R/3).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it must travel a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows. This path is essentially the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to R + r (the sum of the radii of circle B and circle A). Therefore, the length of the path is 2π(R + r) = 2π(R + R/3) = 2π(4R/3).

    The number of revolutions circle A makes is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of circle A. Thus, the number of revolutions is:

    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{\text{Total Distance Traveled}}{\text{Circumference of Circle A}} = \frac{2\pi(4R/3)}{2\pi(R/3)} = \frac{4R/3}{R/3} = 4 \]

    Therefore, circle A will make 4 complete revolutions as it rolls around circle B and returns to its starting position.
    Bob: Thank you. As the negative side, I will argue that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around the circumference of circle B without sliding, it will revolve 3 times in total by the time it returns to its starting point.

    Let's start by agreeing on the basic parameters: the radius of circle B is R, and the radius of circle A is r = R/3. The circumference of circle B is 2πR, and the circumference of circle A is 2πr or 2π(R/3).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it follows a path that is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to R + r (the sum of the radii of circle B and circle A). Therefore, the length of the path is 2π(R + r) = 2π(R + R/3) = 2π(4R/3).

    However, the key point here is to consider the rotation due to the rolling motion along this path. When circle A rolls around circle B, it not only travels the distance of the path but also rotates around its own center. The number of rotations due to the rolling motion is given by the ratio of the path length to the circumference of circle A:

    \[ \text{Number of Rotations Due to Rolling} = \frac{\text{Path Length}}{\text{Circumference of Circle A}} = \frac{2\pi(4R/3)}{2\pi(R/3)} = 4 \]

    But, we must also account for the fact that as circle A completes one full trip around circle B, it has effectively rotated once around its own center due to the circular path. This additional rotation is subtracted from the total rotations due to rolling. Thus, the actual number of revolutions is:

    \[ \text{Total Revolutions} = \text{Rotations Due to Rolling} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \]

    Therefore, circle A will make 3 complete revolutions as it rolls around circle B and returns to its starting position.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed explanations. After carefully considering both arguments, the correct answer is that circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B and returns to its starting position.

    Alice's argument correctly calculates the number of revolutions by taking into account the path length and the circumference of circle A. The key point is that when circle A rolls around circle B, it completes a full trip along the path, which is the circumference of a circle with radius R + r. This path length divided by the circumference of circle A gives the number of revolutions, which is 4.

    Bob's argument introduces an additional consideration of subtracting one revolution due to the circular path, but this is not necessary because the calculation already accounts for the total distance traveled and the rotations due to rolling. The additional rotation around the center of circle B is inherently included in the path length.

    Therefore, Alice's answer is correct: circle A will make 4 complete revolutions.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
