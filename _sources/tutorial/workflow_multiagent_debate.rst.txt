Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. As the affirmative side, I will present the argument that when a smaller circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of a larger circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B without sliding, it will revolve 4 times in total to return to its starting point.

    To understand this, let's denote the radius of circle A as \( r \) and the radius of circle B as \( R \). Given that the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B, we have \( R = 3r \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, the center of circle A traces out a path which is a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, i.e., \( R + r = 3r + r = 4r \). The circumference of this path is \( 2\pi(4r) = 8\pi r \).

    The number of revolutions circle A makes while rolling around this path is the total distance traveled by the center of circle A divided by the circumference of circle A. The circumference of circle A is \( 2\pi r \). Therefore, the number of revolutions is:

    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{\text{Circumference of Path}}{\text{Circumference of Circle A}} = \frac{8\pi r}{2\pi r} = 4 \]

    Thus, circle A will revolve 4 times in total to return to its starting point after rolling around circle B once.
    Bob: Thank you. As the negative side, I will argue that while the calculation provided by the affirmative side is mathematically sound, it does not fully account for the additional rotation of circle A due to its own motion around its center as it rolls around circle B.

    When a smaller circle rolls without slipping around a larger circle, it must rotate an extra time to compensate for the curvature of the path it follows. This is because, as circle A rolls along the circumference of circle B, it also rotates about its own center. The total number of rotations can be understood by considering both the rotation due to the path traced by the center of circle A and the rotation due to the rolling motion itself.

    As correctly pointed out, the center of circle A traces a path with a radius of \(4r\), leading to 4 revolutions based on the path's circumference. However, since there is no relative sliding, each point on the circumference of circle A must touch the circumference of circle B exactly once per full trip around circle B. This means that circle A must make one additional revolution to align with the starting point after completing the path around circle B.

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions is actually:

    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

    Thus, circle A will revolve 5 times in total to return to its starting point after rolling around circle B once.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed presentations. After carefully considering both arguments, the correct answer is that circle A will revolve 5 times in total to return to its starting point after rolling around circle B once.

    Alice's argument correctly calculates the number of revolutions based on the path traced by the center of circle A, which indeed results in 4 revolutions. However, Bob's additional insight about the extra rotation due to the rolling motion itself is crucial. As circle A rolls along the circumference of circle B without slipping, it must make one additional revolution to align with the starting point, bringing the total to 5 revolutions.

    Therefore, the final answer is 5.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  5
