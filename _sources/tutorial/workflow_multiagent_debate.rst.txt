Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. As the affirmative side, I will present my argument for the number of revolutions that circle A makes as it rolls around circle B without sliding.

    Let's denote the radius of circle B as \( R \) and the radius of circle A as \( r \). According to the problem, \( r = \frac{1}{3}R \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows. The center of circle A traces out a circular path with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, which is \( R + r \). Therefore, the circumference of this path is:
    \[ 2\pi (R + r) = 2\pi \left( R + \frac{1}{3}R \right) = 2\pi \left( \frac{4}{3}R \right) = \frac{8\pi R}{3} \]

    The number of revolutions that circle A makes is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of circle A. The circumference of circle A is:
    \[ 2\pi r = 2\pi \left( \frac{1}{3}R \right) = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \]

    Thus, the number of revolutions \( N \) that circle A makes is:
    \[ N = \frac{\text{Total distance traveled}}{\text{Circumference of circle A}} = \frac{\frac{8\pi R}{3}}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = \frac{8\pi R}{3} \times \frac{3}{2\pi R} = 4 \]

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B one complete trip back to its starting point.
    Bob: Thank you. As the negative side, I will present a counter-argument to the number of revolutions that circle A makes as it rolls around circle B without sliding.

    Let's revisit the setup: Circle A has a radius \( r \) and Circle B has a radius \( R \), with \( r = \frac{1}{3}R \). When Circle A rolls around Circle B, its center traces out a circular path with a radius of \( R + r = R + \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{4}{3}R \).

    The circumference of the path traced by the center of Circle A is:
    \[ 2\pi \left( \frac{4}{3}R \right) = \frac{8\pi R}{3} \]

    The circumference of Circle A itself is:
    \[ 2\pi r = 2\pi \left( \frac{1}{3}R \right) = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \]

    Now, let's consider the rolling motion. When Circle A rolls around Circle B, it not only travels along the path but also rotates about its own center. The key point here is that for every full rotation (360 degrees) of Circle A around its own center, it covers a distance equal to its own circumference, which is \( \frac{2\pi R}{3} \).

    However, there is an additional factor to consider: the relative rotation due to the curvature of the path. As Circle A rolls around Circle B, it also rotates once more because it is following the curvature of Circle B. This is often referred to as the "gear effect" or "rolling without slipping."

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions \( N \) that Circle A makes is the sum of the revolutions due to the path length and the additional revolution due to the curvature:
    \[ N = \frac{\text{Total distance traveled}}{\text{Circumference of circle A}} + 1 = \frac{\frac{8\pi R}{3}}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

    Thus, Circle A will revolve 5 times in total as it rolls around Circle B one complete trip back to its starting point.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: The debate has concluded, and after carefully considering the arguments presented by both Alice and Bob, we can determine the correct number of revolutions that circle A makes as it rolls around circle B.

    Alice's argument is based on a straightforward calculation of the distance traveled by the center of circle A and dividing this by the circumference of circle A. This method correctly accounts for the path traced by the center of circle A and the distance covered per revolution of circle A. Her calculation results in 4 revolutions.

    Bob, on the other hand, added an extra revolution to account for what he referred to as the "gear effect" or "rolling without slipping." However, this additional revolution is already included in the distance traveled by the center of circle A, as the no-slipping condition ensures that the rotation due to the curvature of the path is inherently accounted for in the total distance traveled.

    Therefore, the correct answer is that circle A will revolve **4 times** in total as it rolls around circle B one complete trip back to its starting point. Alice's argument is accurate, and she wins the round.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
