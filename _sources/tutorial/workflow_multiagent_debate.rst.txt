Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you for the introduction. As the affirmative side, I will present the argument that when a smaller circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of a larger circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B without sliding, it will revolve 4 times in total by the time it returns to its starting point.

    To understand this, let's consider the following:

    - The circumference of circle A (C_A) is \(2\pi \times r_A\), where \(r_A\) is the radius of circle A.
    - The circumference of circle B (C_B) is \(2\pi \times r_B\), where \(r_B\) is the radius of circle B.
    - Given that \(r_A = \frac{1}{3} r_B\), we can substitute and find that \(C_A = \frac{1}{3} C_B\).

    When circle A rolls around the outside of circle B, the distance it travels along the path is equal to the circumference of the path it follows, which is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, i.e., \(C_{path} = 2\pi (r_A + r_B)\).

    Substituting \(r_A = \frac{1}{3} r_B\), we get:
    \[ C_{path} = 2\pi \left(\frac{1}{3} r_B + r_B\right) = 2\pi \left(\frac{4}{3} r_B\right) = \frac{8}{3} \pi r_B \]

    Since the number of revolutions is the distance traveled divided by the circumference of the rolling circle, the number of revolutions (N) is:
    \[ N = \frac{C_{path}}{C_A} = \frac{\frac{8}{3} \pi r_B}{\frac{1}{3} 2\pi r_B} = \frac{\frac{8}{3} \pi r_B}{\frac{2}{3} \pi r_B} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 4 times as it rolls around circle B and returns to its starting position.
    Bob: Thank you, Alice, for your detailed explanation. However, I must respectfully disagree with the conclusion that circle A will revolve 4 times as it rolls around circle B. The correct number of revolutions is actually 3, and here's why:

    When a smaller circle rolls around a larger circle without sliding, the total distance traveled by the center of the smaller circle is the circumference of the path it follows, which is the sum of the radii of both circles. This is \(C_{path} = 2\pi (r_A + r_B)\).

    Given that \(r_A = \frac{1}{3} r_B\), we can substitute and find:
    \[ C_{path} = 2\pi \left(\frac{1}{3} r_B + r_B\right) = 2\pi \left(\frac{4}{3} r_B\right) = \frac{8}{3} \pi r_B \]

    The key point here is to consider the relative motion of the two circles. As circle A rolls around circle B, it not only travels the distance of the path but also rotates due to its own circumference. The number of rotations (R) that circle A makes about its own center as it rolls around circle B is given by the ratio of the path's circumference to the circumference of circle A:
    \[ R = \frac{C_{path}}{C_A} = \frac{\frac{8}{3} \pi r_B}{\frac{2}{3} \pi r_B} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

    However, one of these rotations is due to the fact that circle A has to complete a full rotation just to return to its original orientation relative to circle B. This is known as the "extra" or "relative" rotation. Therefore, the actual number of self-rotations (revolutions) of circle A, excluding the one that aligns it back to its starting orientation, is:
    \[ N = R - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \]

    Thus, when circle A completes one trip around circle B, it will have revolved 3 times in total.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your insightful arguments. After carefully reviewing the points made by both of you, it is clear that the correct answer is 3 revolutions.

    Bob's explanation correctly accounts for the relative motion between the two circles and the fact that one of the rotations is due to the need for circle A to return to its original orientation relative to circle B. Therefore, when circle A completes a full trip around circle B, it will have revolved 3 times in total, not 4, as the fourth rotation is simply the reorientation of circle A to match its starting position.

    Hence, the winner of this round is Bob, with the correct answer being 3 revolutions.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  3
