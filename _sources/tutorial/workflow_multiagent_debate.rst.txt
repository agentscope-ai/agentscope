Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. As the affirmative side, I will argue that when Circle A, with a radius one-third that of Circle B, rolls around the circumference of Circle B without sliding, it will complete 4 full revolutions by the time it returns to its starting point.

    To understand why, let's break down the problem:

    1. **Circumference Relationship**: The circumference of a circle is given by \( C = 2\pi r \). If the radius of Circle B is \( R \), then the radius of Circle A is \( \frac{R}{3} \). Therefore, the circumference of Circle B is \( 2\pi R \) and the circumference of Circle A is \( 2\pi \left(\frac{R}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \).

    2. **Distance Traveled by Circle A**: When Circle A rolls around Circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of Circle B, which is \( 2\pi R \).

    3. **Number of Revolutions**: The number of times Circle A revolves is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of Circle A. So, the number of revolutions is:
       \[
       \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Circumference of Circle A}} = \frac{2\pi R}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = \frac{2\pi R \times 3}{2\pi R} = 3
       \]

    However, this calculation only accounts for the rotations due to the linear motion along the circumference of Circle B. We must also consider the additional rotation due to the fact that Circle A is rotating around Circle B. Since Circle A completes one full loop around Circle B, it undergoes an additional revolution.

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions is:
    \[
    \text{Total Revolutions} = 3 + 1 = 4
    \]

    Thus, Circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around Circle B and returns to its starting point.
    Bob: Thank you, and I will be presenting the negative side of the argument. I disagree with the conclusion that Circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around Circle B and returns to its starting point.

    Let's re-examine the problem:

    1. **Circumference Relationship**: As correctly stated by the affirmative, the circumference of Circle B is \( 2\pi R \) and the circumference of Circle A is \( \frac{2\pi R}{3} \).

    2. **Distance Traveled by Circle A**: When Circle A rolls around Circle B, it indeed travels a distance equal to the circumference of Circle B, which is \( 2\pi R \).

    3. **Number of Revolutions Due to Linear Motion**: The number of revolutions due to the linear motion along the circumference of Circle B is:
       \[
       \text{Number of Revolutions (Linear)} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Circumference of Circle A}} = \frac{2\pi R}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = 3
       \]

    However, we need to carefully consider the additional rotation due to the circular path. When Circle A rolls around Circle B, it also rotates around the center of Circle B. This additional rotation is not an extra revolution but rather a part of the overall rotational motion. 

    To understand this, imagine if Circle A were fixed at a point on Circle B and Circle B rotated. In this case, Circle A would rotate once around its own center. Since Circle A is rolling without sliding, it must complete exactly one full rotation relative to the center of Circle B as it goes around. This rotation is already accounted for in the 3 revolutions calculated from the linear motion.

    Therefore, the correct total number of revolutions is simply the 3 revolutions due to the linear motion, and there is no need to add an extra revolution. Thus, the total number of revolutions Circle A makes as it rolls around Circle B and returns to its starting point is 3, not 4.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed arguments. Let's summarize the key points and determine the correct answer.

    Alice argued that Circle A, with a radius one-third of Circle B, will complete 4 full revolutions as it rolls around Circle B. She calculated 3 revolutions due to the linear motion along the circumference of Circle B and added an extra revolution because Circle A completes a full loop around Circle B.

    Bob, on the other hand, contended that the total number of revolutions is 3. He agreed with the 3 revolutions due to the linear motion but argued that the additional rotation due to the circular path is already accounted for in the 3 revolutions and should not be counted as an extra revolution.

    Upon careful consideration, the correct answer is that Circle A will revolve 3 times in total as it rolls around Circle B and returns to its starting point. The 3 revolutions account for both the linear motion and the rotational motion around Circle B. Adding an extra revolution would be double-counting the rotational motion.

    Therefore, Bob's argument is correct. The total number of revolutions is 3.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  3
