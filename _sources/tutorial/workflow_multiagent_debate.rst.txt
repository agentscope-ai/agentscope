Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Certainly. To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the two circles and how the smaller circle (circle A) revolves around the larger one (circle B). Given that the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B, we can use the concept of circumference to determine the number of revolutions.

    Let's denote:
    - The radius of circle A as r.
    - The radius of circle B as R, where R = 3r.

    The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr. Therefore, the circumferences are:
    - For circle A: C_A = 2πr
    - For circle B: C_B = 2πR = 2π(3r) = 6πr

    When circle A rolls around the outside of circle B without slipping, it will have to travel a distance equal to the circumference of the path it takes, which is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of both circles, or R + r = 4r. Hence, the total distance traveled by circle A is:
    - Total distance = 2π(R + r) = 2π(4r) = 8πr

    Since circle A does not slip, the distance it travels must be an integer multiple of its own circumference. The number of times circle A revolves is the total distance divided by the circumference of circle A:

    Number of revolutions = Total distance / C_A
                          = 8πr / 2πr
                          = 8 / 2
                          = 4

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 4 times in total when it rolls around circle B once. This is my argument for the affirmative side.
    Bob: Thank you, Alice. I appreciate your detailed explanation, but I believe there is a subtle point that has been overlooked. When circle A rolls around the outside of circle B, it not only travels the distance equal to the circumference of the path (which is 8πr as you correctly calculated), but it also revolves around its own center due to the curvature of the path.

    To understand this, consider that as circle A rolls along the path, it will make one additional revolution for every full rotation around circle B. This is because the point of contact on circle A changes as it rolls, and by the time it completes the path around circle B, it would have made an extra revolution to align with the starting point again.

    Therefore, we need to add one more revolution to the 4 revolutions that are due to the linear distance traveled. This brings the total number of revolutions to 5.

    In conclusion, when circle A rolls around the outside of circle B, it will revolve 5 times in total.
    Aggregator: The debate has concluded with two different answers. Alice argues that circle A will revolve 4 times, while Bob contends that it will revolve 5 times, adding an extra revolution due to the curvature of the path around circle B. The correct number of revolutions is indeed 4, as the additional revolution suggested by Bob is already accounted for in the calculation of the total distance traveled (8πr) divided by the circumference of circle A (2πr). Therefore, the final answer is 4 revolutions.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
