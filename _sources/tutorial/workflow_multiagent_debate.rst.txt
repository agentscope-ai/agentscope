Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to present my viewpoint on this intriguing problem. To begin, let's establish some basic facts about the two circles. Let's denote the radius of circle B as \( R \) and the radius of circle A as \( r \). According to the problem, \( r = \frac{1}{3}R \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B without slipping, it will travel a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows. This path is essentially a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of both circles, which is \( R + r = R + \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{4}{3}R \).

    The circumference of this path is:
    \[ C_{\text{path}} = 2\pi \left(\frac{4}{3}R\right) = \frac{8}{3}\pi R \]

    Circle A, while rolling along this path, will also rotate around its own center. The number of revolutions that circle A makes is given by the ratio of the distance it travels (the circumference of the path) to its own circumference.

    The circumference of circle A is:
    \[ C_A = 2\pi r = 2\pi \left(\frac{1}{3}R\right) = \frac{2}{3}\pi R \]

    Thus, the number of revolutions (\( N \)) that circle A makes is:
    \[ N = \frac{C_{\text{path}}}{C_A} = \frac{\frac{8}{3}\pi R}{\frac{2}{3}\pi R} = \frac{8}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = 4 \]

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B once.
    Bob: Thank you, and I appreciate the thorough explanation provided by my colleague. However, I would like to present a different perspective on this problem.

    When circle A rolls around circle B without slipping, it's important to consider not only the distance it travels along the path but also the rotational motion due to the tangential contact between the two circles. The key point here is that while circle A is moving around circle B, it is also rotating about its own center.

    Let's revisit the setup: Circle A has a radius \( r = \frac{1}{3}R \), and circle B has a radius \( R \). As circle A rolls around circle B, it follows a path with a circumference of \( 2\pi (R + r) = 2\pi \left(R + \frac{1}{3}R\right) = \frac{8}{3}\pi R \).

    However, we must account for the fact that as circle A rolls, it also rotates around its own axis. For every full rotation of circle A around its own center, it covers a distance equal to its own circumference, which is \( 2\pi r = 2\pi \left(\frac{1}{3}R\right) = \frac{2}{3}\pi R \).

    To find out how many times circle A rotates, we need to consider both the linear distance traveled and the additional rotations due to the rolling motion. The total number of revolutions can be calculated by adding one extra revolution for each time circle A completes a full loop around circle B, because it will have made an additional rotation due to the curvature of the path.

    Thus, the total number of revolutions is:
    \[ N = \frac{\text{Circumference of the path}}{\text{Circumference of circle A}} + 1 = \frac{\frac{8}{3}\pi R}{\frac{2}{3}\pi R} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 5 times in total as it rolls around circle B once.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed explanations. Let's review the key points to determine the correct number of revolutions that circle A makes as it rolls around circle B.

    Alice correctly calculated the path circumference as \( \frac{8}{3}\pi R \) and the circumference of circle A as \( \frac{2}{3}\pi R \). She then determined the number of revolutions by dividing the path circumference by the circumference of circle A, which yields:
    \[ N = \frac{\frac{8}{3}\pi R}{\frac{2}{3}\pi R} = 4 \]

    Bob, on the other hand, suggested adding an extra revolution due to the curvature of the path. However, this additional rotation is already accounted for in the calculation of the path circumference. The rolling motion without slipping means that the total distance traveled by the point of contact on circle A is exactly the path circumference, and the number of revolutions is given by the ratio of these two circumferences.

    Therefore, the correct answer is that circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B once. Alice's reasoning and calculations are accurate.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
