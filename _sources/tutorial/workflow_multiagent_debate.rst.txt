Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you, and I'm glad to be on the affirmative side for this debate. The topic at hand is to determine how many times circle A, which has a radius 1/3 that of circle B, will revolve as it rolls around the circumference of circle B without sliding.

    To solve this, we need to consider both the rotation due to the movement along the circumference of circle B (which we can call the "external" rotation) and the rotation due to the curvature of circle A itself (the "internal" rotation).

    Let's denote:
    - The radius of circle B as \( R \).
    - The radius of circle A as \( r = \frac{1}{3}R \).

    When circle A completes one trip around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows, which is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, i.e., \( R + r = R + \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{4}{3}R \). The circumference of this path is then \( 2\pi \times \frac{4}{3}R = \frac{8}{3}\pi R \).

    The number of external rotations of circle A is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of circle A, which is \( 2\pi r = 2\pi \times \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}\pi R \). Therefore, the number of external rotations is:

    \[ \text{External rotations} = \frac{\frac{8}{3}\pi R}{\frac{2}{3}\pi R} = 4 \]

    However, as circle A rolls around circle B, it also rotates about its own center. Since there is no relative sliding, each point on the circumference of circle A touches the ground (or in this case, the surface of circle B) exactly once per full revolution of circle A. This means that for every full trip around circle B, circle A will have completed an additional internal rotation equal to the number of times it would normally rotate if it were rolling on a straight line for the same distance.

    Thus, the total number of revolutions of circle A is the sum of the external and internal rotations, which is:

    \[ \text{Total revolutions} = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

    Therefore, my stance is that circle A will revolve 5 times in total as it rolls around circle B.
    Bob: Thank you, and I'm here to present the negative side of the argument. While Alice's explanation is quite thorough, there is a subtle point that needs clarification regarding the total number of revolutions of circle A.

    When circle A rolls around circle B without sliding, it indeed travels a distance equal to the circumference of the path with a radius \( R + r = \frac{4}{3}R \), which is \( \frac{8}{3}\pi R \). The number of external rotations (rotations due to the movement along the circumference of circle B) is correctly calculated as 4.

    However, the internal rotation (the rotation about its own center) does not add an additional full revolution in this scenario. When a smaller circle rolls around a larger circle, the point of contact on the smaller circle traces out a path that is exactly one full rotation less than the number of external rotations. This is because the point of contact on the smaller circle starts at a certain position relative to the larger circle and ends up at the same position after one complete trip, but the smaller circle has already completed its "internal" rotation while rolling along the larger circle.

    Thus, the correct calculation for the total number of revolutions of circle A is simply the number of external rotations, which is:

    \[ \text{Total revolutions} = 4 \]

    Therefore, my stance is that circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed explanations. The correct answer is that circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B.

    Alice's argument correctly identified the number of external rotations, which is 4, by considering the path length and the circumference of circle A. However, the internal rotation does not add an additional full revolution in this case. As Bob pointed out, when a smaller circle rolls around a larger circle without sliding, the point of contact on the smaller circle traces out a path that results in one less full rotation than the number of external rotations. This is because the point of contact on the smaller circle returns to its original position after completing the path around the larger circle, effectively "canceling out" one of the internal rotations.

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions of circle A is indeed 4, as stated by Bob. Thank you both for your contributions, and I hope this clarifies the correct answer.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
