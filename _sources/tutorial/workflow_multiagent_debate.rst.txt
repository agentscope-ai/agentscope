Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you, and I'm glad to present the affirmative side of this debate. The topic at hand is to determine how many times circle A will revolve in total as it rolls around the outside of circle B, given that the radius of circle A (r) is 1/3 the radius of circle B (R), and there is no relative sliding between them.

    To start, let's consider the circumference of each circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr. Therefore, the circumference of circle A (C_A) is 2πr, and the circumference of circle B (C_B) is 2πR. Since r = R/3, we can express the circumferences as:

    - C_A = 2π(R/3)
    - C_B = 2πR

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows, which is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, i.e., R + r. This gives us the path length (L):

    - L = 2π(R + r)

    Since r = R/3, then R + r = R + R/3 = 4R/3, and thus the path length is:

    - L = 2π(4R/3) = 8πR/3

    Now, to find out how many times circle A revolves, we need to divide the path length by the circumference of circle A:

    - Number of revolutions = L / C_A
    - Number of revolutions = (8πR/3) / (2πR/3)
    - Number of revolutions = (8πR/3) * (3/2πR)
    - Number of revolutions = 4

    Therefore, my argument is that as circle A rolls around circle B without sliding, it will complete 4 full revolutions by the time it returns to its starting point.
    Bob: Thank you, and I'm here to present the negative side of this debate. While Alice's calculations for the path length and the number of revolutions based on the circumference are correct, there is an additional factor that needs to be considered when a smaller circle rolls around a larger one without sliding: the rotation due to the curvature of the larger circle.

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it does not only rotate because of the distance it travels along the path (which is indeed 4 times its own circumference), but it also rotates due to the fact that it is constantly changing direction as it follows the curve of circle B. This is known as the "rolling without slipping" condition, which means that at every point of contact, the two circles have the same tangential velocity.

    To understand this, imagine a point on the circumference of circle A. As circle A rolls around circle B, this point will touch the surface of circle B exactly once per revolution of circle A relative to the center of circle B. Since circle A has to go around the full circumference of circle B, this point will touch the surface of circle B three times (since the radius of A is 1/3 that of B, meaning it fits into the circumference of B three times).

    Therefore, in addition to the 4 rotations due to the path length, there are 3 additional rotations due to the change in direction as circle A goes around circle B. This results in a total of 4 + 3 = 7 revolutions.

    In conclusion, my argument is that circle A will complete 7 full revolutions by the time it returns to its starting point after rolling around circle B.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed arguments. After careful consideration of both sides, the correct answer is that circle A will complete 4 full revolutions as it rolls around the outside of circle B.

    Alice's argument correctly identifies that the number of revolutions can be determined by dividing the path length (the circumference of the combined radii) by the circumference of circle A. The path length is indeed \( \frac{8\pi R}{3} \), and the circumference of circle A is \( \frac{2\pi R}{3} \). Dividing these two values gives us 4, which is the number of times circle A revolves relative to the ground.

    Bob, while your point about the rolling without slipping condition is valid, it does not add extra revolutions in this context. The 4 revolutions already account for the fact that circle A is constantly changing direction as it follows the curve of circle B. Each time circle A completes a revolution around its own center, it also moves forward along the path, and after 4 such revolutions, it will have completed one trip around circle B.

    Therefore, the final answer is 4 revolutions.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
