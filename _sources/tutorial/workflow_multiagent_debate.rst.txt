Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. I will argue in favor of the following position: when circle A, with a radius one-third that of circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B without sliding, it will complete 4 revolutions in total by the time it returns to its starting point. My argument is based on the fact that the circumference of circle A is one-third that of circle B, and as circle A rolls around, it must cover a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows, which is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B. This larger circle has a circumference 4 times that of circle A, hence 4 revolutions.
    Bob: I understand the argument presented by the affirmative side, but I will provide a counter-argument. The key point to consider here is that when circle A rolls around the outside of circle B, it's not just moving in a straight line; it's also rotating around the center of circle B. This means that while circle A does indeed cover a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows, which is 4 times its own circumference, it also has to account for the rotation about the external point.

    The total number of revolutions of circle A can be calculated as the sum of the revolutions due to its linear movement along the path and the revolutions due to its rotation around the center of circle B. Since the radius of circle A is one-third that of circle B, the center of circle A will make one full revolution around the center of circle B. Therefore, we need to add this one revolution to the 3 revolutions from the linear travel (since the path is 3 times the circumference of circle A).

    In conclusion, circle A will actually complete 3 (from the linear path) + 1 (from the rotation around the center of circle B) = 4 - 1 = 3 revolutions in total, not 4, as the additional revolution is already accounted for in the path length.
    Aggregator: The debate has concluded, and both debaters have presented their arguments. Alice's argument is that circle A will complete 4 revolutions as it rolls around the outside of circle B. Bob agrees with the total path length being 4 times the circumference of circle A but argues that one of those revolutions is due to the rotation around the center of circle B, which should not be counted again, leading to a total of 3 revolutions.

    Upon careful consideration, the correct answer is that circle A will indeed make 4 revolutions in total. The key insight is that when a smaller circle rolls around a larger one without sliding, the number of its own revolutions is equal to the ratio of the distance it travels (the circumference of the path) to its own circumference. Since the path is 4 times the circumference of circle A, it will revolve 4 times, even though one of these revolutions is also a result of orbiting around the center of circle B. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 revolutions.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
