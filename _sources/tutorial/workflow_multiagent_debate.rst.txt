Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. As the affirmative side, I will present the argument that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B, it will complete 4 revolutions in total by the time it returns to its starting point.

    To understand this, let's denote the radius of circle A as \( r \) and the radius of circle B as \( R = 3r \). The circumference of a circle is given by \( C = 2\pi \times \text{radius} \), so the circumference of circle A is \( C_A = 2\pi r \) and the circumference of circle B is \( C_B = 2\pi (3r) = 6\pi r \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows, which is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, i.e., \( R + r = 3r + r = 4r \). Therefore, the length of the path is \( 2\pi (4r) = 8\pi r \).

    Since the distance that circle A travels is \( 8\pi r \) and the circumference of circle A is \( 2\pi r \), the number of revolutions circle A makes is the ratio of these two distances:
    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{8\pi r}{2\pi r} = \frac{8}{2} = 4. \]

    Thus, circle A completes 4 full revolutions as it rolls around the outside of circle B and returns to its starting position.
    Bob: Thank you. As the negative side, I will argue that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B, it will complete 3 revolutions in total by the time it returns to its starting point, not 4 as proposed by the affirmative side.

    Let's review the setup: the radius of circle A is \( r \) and the radius of circle B is \( R = 3r \). The circumference of circle A is \( C_A = 2\pi r \), and the circumference of circle B is \( C_B = 6\pi r \).

    When circle A rolls around the outside of circle B, it travels along a path whose length is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, which is \( R + r = 4r \). Thus, the length of this path is \( 8\pi r \).

    However, the key point here is to consider the relative motion of the two circles. Circle A is rolling without slipping, meaning that for every rotation, it covers a distance equal to its own circumference. As circle A rolls around circle B, it also rotates around its own center. To find out how many times circle A rotates, we need to account for both the linear distance it travels and the fact that it is rotating around the center of circle B.

    The number of rotations due to the linear travel is:
    \[ \frac{8\pi r}{2\pi r} = 4. \]

    But since circle A is also rotating around the center of circle B, we must subtract one revolution because the orientation of circle A at the end of the trip is the same as at the beginning (it has completed a full orbit around circle B). This means that one of the "revolutions" counted in the linear travel is actually just the result of the circular path around circle B, not an additional rotation of circle A about its own axis.

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions of circle A about its own center is:
    \[ 4 - 1 = 3. \]

    Thus, circle A completes 3 full revolutions as it rolls around the outside of circle B and returns to its starting position.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you both, Alice and Bob, for your detailed explanations. Let's review the arguments and determine the correct number of revolutions that circle A makes as it rolls around the outside of circle B.

    Alice argued that since the total distance traveled by circle A is \( 8\pi r \) and its own circumference is \( 2\pi r \), the number of revolutions is:
    \[ \frac{8\pi r}{2\pi r} = 4. \]

    Bob, on the other hand, pointed out that while the linear travel does indeed result in 4 revolutions, one of these "revolutions" is actually due to the circular path around circle B, not an additional rotation of circle A about its own axis. Therefore, the total number of rotations of circle A about its own center is:
    \[ 4 - 1 = 3. \]

    The key point here is that when circle A completes a full orbit around circle B, it returns to its original orientation, which means one of the counted revolutions is simply the result of the circular path and not an independent rotation. Thus, the correct number of revolutions of circle A about its own center is 3.

    Therefore, the correct answer is 3 revolutions. Bob's argument is accurate, and I conclude that circle A will complete 3 full revolutions as it rolls around the outside of circle B and returns to its starting position.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  3
