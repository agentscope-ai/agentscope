Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you. As the affirmative side, I will argue that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around circle B one trip back to its starting point, it will revolve 4 times in total.

    To understand this, let's start by considering the circumference of each circle. If we denote the radius of circle B as R, then the radius of circle A is R/3. The circumference of a circle is given by 2π times the radius. Therefore, the circumference of circle B (C_B) is 2πR and the circumference of circle A (C_A) is 2π(R/3) = (2πR)/3.

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it will travel a distance equal to the circumference of the path it takes. This path is a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, which is R + R/3 = (4/3)R. Thus, the length of the path (L_path) is 2π times (4/3)R, or L_path = (8πR)/3.

    The number of revolutions (N) that circle A makes is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of circle A. So, N = L_path / C_A = ((8πR)/3) / ((2πR)/3) = 4.

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 4 times as it rolls around circle B once.
    Bob: Thank you. As the negative side, I will argue that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around circle B one trip back to its starting point, it will revolve 3 times in total, not 4.

    To begin with, let's agree on the basic setup: if the radius of circle B is R, then the radius of circle A is R/3. The circumference of circle B (C_B) is 2πR and the circumference of circle A (C_A) is (2πR)/3.

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it does not just travel along the path; it also rotates due to the curvature of the path. The path that circle A follows is a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, which is R + R/3 = (4/3)R. Thus, the length of the path (L_path) is 2π times (4/3)R, or L_path = (8πR)/3.

    However, the key point here is that as circle A rolls around circle B, it completes one additional revolution due to the rotation about its own center as it goes around the larger circle. This can be visualized by considering that after completing the path around circle B, the orientation of circle A would have changed as if it had made an extra full turn.

    Thus, the number of revolutions (N) that circle A makes is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of circle A, plus one additional revolution for the rotation around its own center. So, N = (L_path / C_A) - 1 = ((8πR)/3) / ((2πR)/3) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 3 times as it rolls around circle B once, taking into account both the linear travel and the rotational component.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: The debate has concluded, and the correct answer is that circle A will revolve 4 times as it rolls around circle B one trip back to its starting point. Alice's argument correctly accounts for the total number of revolutions by considering the distance traveled along the path and the circumference of circle A. Bob's point about an additional revolution due to the rotation around its own center is a common misconception; in fact, the additional rotation is already included in the calculation of the path length relative to the smaller circle's circumference. Therefore, Alice's reasoning and conclusion are accurate.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
