Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you for the introduction. As the affirmative side, I will present the argument that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B without sliding, it will complete 4 full revolutions.

    To understand this, let's break down the problem:

    - Let the radius of circle B be \( r \).
    - Then, the radius of circle A is \( \frac{r}{3} \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of the path it follows. The path is the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, which is \( r + \frac{r}{3} = \frac{4r}{3} \).

    The circumference of this path is:
    \[ C_{\text{path}} = 2\pi \left(\frac{4r}{3}\right) = \frac{8\pi r}{3} \]

    The circumference of circle A, which is the distance it covers in one revolution, is:
    \[ C_A = 2\pi \left(\frac{r}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi r}{3} \]

    The number of revolutions circle A makes as it rolls around circle B is the total distance traveled divided by the circumference of circle A:
    \[ \text{Revolutions} = \frac{C_{\text{path}}}{C_A} = \frac{\frac{8\pi r}{3}}{\frac{2\pi r}{3}} = \frac{8\pi r}{3} \times \frac{3}{2\pi r} = 4 \]

    Therefore, circle A will make 4 complete revolutions as it rolls around circle B.
    Bob: Thank you, Alice, for your detailed explanation. While I appreciate the thorough breakdown of the problem, I must disagree with the conclusion that circle A will make 4 complete revolutions around circle B. Let's revisit the scenario and consider an additional factor: the relative rotation between the two circles.

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it does not only move along the path but also rotates in relation to circle B. The key point here is that as circle A rolls around circle B, it has to rotate once more due to the curvature of the path it follows. This extra rotation is often overlooked and can be explained by the concept of a "curvature-induced" rotation.

    Here's the corrected calculation:

    - The circumference of the path that circle A follows (as calculated by Alice) is \( \frac{8\pi r}{3} \).
    - The circumference of circle A is \( \frac{2\pi r}{3} \).

    The number of rotations due to the path length is:
    \[ \text{Revolutions (path)} = \frac{\frac{8\pi r}{3}}{\frac{2\pi r}{3}} = 4 \]

    However, since circle A is rolling without sliding, it must also account for the additional rotation due to the curvature. This means that as circle A completes one full loop around circle B, it must also rotate an additional time to align with its starting orientation. Therefore, the total number of revolutions is:
    \[ \text{Total Revolutions} = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

    Thus, circle A will make 5 complete revolutions as it rolls around circle B.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed explanations. After carefully reviewing both arguments, the correct answer is that circle A will make 4 complete revolutions as it rolls around circle B.

    Alice's calculation is accurate. The number of revolutions is determined by the ratio of the path length to the circumference of circle A. The path length is \( \frac{8\pi r}{3} \) and the circumference of circle A is \( \frac{2\pi r}{3} \). Therefore, the number of revolutions is:
    \[ \text{Revolutions} = \frac{\frac{8\pi r}{3}}{\frac{2\pi r}{3}} = 4 \]

    Bob's argument about an additional rotation due to curvature is a common misconception. The extra rotation that Bob refers to is already accounted for in the path length calculation. When circle A completes one full loop around circle B, it has already rotated 4 times, which includes the necessary alignment with its starting orientation.

    Thus, the correct answer is 4 revolutions. Thank you both for your participation and well-reasoned arguments.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
