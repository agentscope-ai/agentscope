Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you for the introduction. As the affirmative side, I will present the argument that when a smaller circle (circle A) with a radius 1/3 that of a larger circle (circle B) rolls around the outside of the larger circle without slipping, it will complete 4 full revolutions.

    To understand this, let's consider the following:

    - Let the radius of circle B be \( R \).
    - Then the radius of circle A is \( \frac{R}{3} \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, the distance that the center of circle A travels is the circumference of the path traced by the center of circle A. This path is a circle with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of circles A and B, which is \( R + \frac{R}{3} = \frac{4R}{3} \).

    The circumference of this path is:
    \[ C_{path} = 2\pi \times \frac{4R}{3} = \frac{8\pi R}{3} \]

    The circumference of circle A itself is:
    \[ C_A = 2\pi \times \frac{R}{3} = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \]

    The number of times circle A revolves as it rolls around circle B is the ratio of the distance traveled by the center of circle A to the circumference of circle A:
    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{C_{path}}{C_A} = \frac{\frac{8\pi R}{3}}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = \frac{8\pi R}{3} \times \frac{3}{2\pi R} = 4 \]

    Therefore, circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B once.
    Bob: Thank you, Alice, for your detailed explanation. I will be presenting the argument from the negative side. While I agree with the mathematical approach to calculating the number of revolutions, I believe there is a common misconception in the way the problem is often interpreted.

    The key point to consider here is not just the distance traveled by the center of circle A, but also the additional revolution that occurs due to the rolling motion around the larger circle B. When a smaller circle rolls around the outside of a larger circle, it not only travels the distance equal to the circumference of the path traced by its center but also completes an extra revolution due to the nature of the circular motion.

    Here's the reasoning:

    - The path traced by the center of circle A has a length of \( \frac{8\pi R}{3} \) as calculated.
    - The circumference of circle A is \( \frac{2\pi R}{3} \).

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it does indeed travel a distance of \( \frac{8\pi R}{3} \), which corresponds to 4 times its own circumference. However, this calculation only accounts for the linear distance covered and does not include the fact that circle A must also complete one full revolution around its own axis to return to its original orientation relative to an external observer.

    Thus, the total number of revolutions is:
    \[ 4 \text{ (from the path)} + 1 \text{ (from the rolling motion)} = 5 \]

    Therefore, my argument is that circle A will actually revolve 5 times in total as it rolls around circle B once.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: The debate has concluded, and after evaluating the arguments presented by both Alice and Bob, the correct answer is that circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around circle B once. 

    Alice's argument correctly calculates the number of revolutions based on the distance traveled by the center of circle A and the circumference of circle A itself. The key point here is that when a smaller circle rolls around a larger one without slipping, the total number of revolutions is determined solely by the ratio of the path length to the smaller circle's circumference, which in this case is 4.

    Bob's additional consideration of an "extra" revolution due to the rolling motion is a common misconception. In fact, the 4 revolutions already account for the complete circular motion and the return to the original orientation. Therefore, the final answer is 4 revolutions.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
