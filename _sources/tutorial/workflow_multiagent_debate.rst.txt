Multi-Agent Debate
========================

Debate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.
Typically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.

We implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their
arguments based on the previous debate history.
At each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.

    Alice: Thank you for the introduction. As the affirmative side, I will argue that when circle A, with a radius 1/3 that of circle B, rolls around the outside of circle B without sliding, it will revolve 4 times in total by the time it returns to its starting point.

    To understand this, let's break down the problem:

    - Let the radius of circle B be \( R \).
    - Then, the radius of circle A is \( \frac{R}{3} \).

    The circumference of circle B, which is the path that circle A must follow, is given by:
    \[ C_B = 2\pi R \]

    The circumference of circle A is:
    \[ C_A = 2\pi \left(\frac{R}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \]

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of circle B. The number of revolutions circle A makes while traveling this distance is the ratio of the path length (circumference of circle B) to the circumference of circle A:
    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{C_B}{C_A} = \frac{2\pi R}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = 3 \]

    However, we must also consider the rotation due to the fact that circle A is rolling around circle B. This additional rotation can be understood by considering the relative motion. Circle A not only revolves around circle B but also rotates about its own center as it moves along the circumference of circle B. By the time it completes one full trip around circle B, it has also completed an additional revolution due to this rotation.

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions made by circle A is:
    \[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

    Thus, circle A will revolve 4 times in total.
    Bob: Thank you, Alice, for your detailed explanation. As the negative side, I will argue that circle A will revolve 3 times in total, not 4, by the time it returns to its starting point after rolling around the outside of circle B without sliding.

    To clarify, let's revisit the key points:

    - The radius of circle B is \( R \).
    - The radius of circle A is \( \frac{R}{3} \).

    The circumference of circle B (the path that circle A follows) is:
    \[ C_B = 2\pi R \]

    The circumference of circle A is:
    \[ C_A = 2\pi \left(\frac{R}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \]

    When circle A rolls around circle B, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of circle B. The number of revolutions circle A makes while traveling this distance is the ratio of the path length (circumference of circle B) to the circumference of circle A:
    \[ \text{Number of Revolutions} = \frac{C_B}{C_A} = \frac{2\pi R}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = 3 \]

    Now, it's important to note that the additional rotation due to the fact that circle A is rolling around circle B is already accounted for in the calculation above. The 3 revolutions include both the motion along the circumference of circle B and the rotation about its own center. There is no need to add an extra revolution because the 3 revolutions are inclusive of the complete rotational movement as circle A traverses the circumference of circle B.

    Thus, the correct number of total revolutions made by circle A is 3, not 4.

            }
        ]
    }
    Aggregator: Thank you, Alice and Bob, for your detailed explanations. After carefully considering both arguments, the correct answer is that circle A will revolve 4 times in total as it rolls around the outside of circle B without sliding.

    Alice's argument correctly identifies that the number of revolutions includes both the motion along the circumference of circle B and the additional rotation about its own center. The calculation shows that circle A makes 3 full rotations due to the distance traveled (circumference of circle B divided by the circumference of circle A), and an additional 1 revolution due to the rolling motion around circle B.

    Therefore, the total number of revolutions made by circle A is:
    \[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

    Thus, Alice's side is correct, and the total number of revolutions is 4.

    The debate is finished, and the correct answer is:  4
