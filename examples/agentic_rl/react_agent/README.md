# Training agent workflows with RL using Trinity-RFT

AgentScope exposes a `learn` interface to train agent workflows using reinforcement learning (RL).
The `learn` interface leverages [Trinity-RFT](https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT), which supports training agents with minimal code changes.

## How to implement

Here we use a math problem solving scenario as an example to illustrate how to convert an existing agent workflow into a trainable workflow function.

Suppose you have an agent workflow that solves math problems using the `ReActAgent`

```python
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent

# model = ...  # Initialize your ChatModel here

query = "What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?"
agent = ReActAgent(
    name="react_agent",
    sys_prompt="You are a helpful math problem solving agent.",
    model=model,
    enable_meta_tool=True,
    formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
)

response = await agent.reply(
    msg=Msg("user", query, role="user"),
)

print(response)
```

### Step 1: Define a workflow function

To train an agent workflow using RL, you need to implement a workflow function with the following signature.

```python
def workflow_function(
    task: Dict,
    model: TrinityChatModel,
) -> float:
    """Run the agent workflow on a single task and return a scalar reward."""
```

Inputs:

- `task`: A dictionary representing a single training task, converted from a sample in the training dataset. For example, in a math problem solving task, `task` may contain `question` and `answer` fields.

- `model`: A `TrinityChatModel` instance, which has the same interface as `OpenAIChatModel`, but it supports automatically converting invoke history into trainable data that can be used by Trinity-RFT.

Outputs:

- A scalar reward (float) indicating the quality of the agent's response on the given task.

### Step 2: Initialize and run the agent using the provided task and model

Since the `model` has the same interface as `OpenAIChatModel`, you can directly use it to initialize the agent.

However, the `task` dictionary is a sample from the training dataset, and it varies based on the training dataset.

Suppose your training dataset is a `.jsonl` file with samples like:

```json
{"question": "What is 2 + 2?", "answer": "4"}
{"question": "What is 4 + 4?", "answer": "8"}
```

In this case, you can extract the `question` field from `task` to run the agent:

```python
def workflow_function(
    task: Dict,
    model: TrinityChatModel,
) -> float:
    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="react_agent",
        sys_prompt="You are a helpful math problem solving agent.",
        model=model,
        enable_meta_tool=True,
        formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
    )

    response = await agent.reply(
        msg=Msg("user", task["question"], role="user"),
    )

    # TODO
```

### Step 3: Implement a reward calculation mechanism

To train the agent using RL, you need to define a reward calculation mechanism that computes a reward based on the agent's response.

Continuing from the previous code snippet, suppose you want to give a reward of `1.0` if the agent's answer matches the ground truth answer in `task["answer"]`, and `0.0` otherwise.

```python
def calculate_reward(answer: str, truth: str) -> float:
    """Simple reward: 1.0 for exact match, else 0.0."""
    return 1.0 if answer.strip() == truth.strip() else 0.0
```

To facilitate reward calculation, you can define a structured response model that allows easy parsing of the agent's output.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResponseStructure(BaseModel):
    """Response structure for math tasks (simplified).
    This structure let the agent output be easily parsed,
    allowing for easy reward calculation.
    """

    result: str = Field(description="Final answer to the math problem.")

# response = await agent.reply(
#     msg=Msg("user", task["question"], role="user"),
#     structured_model=ResponseStructure,  # <-- specify structured model here
# )
```

### Step 4: Use `learn` to train the workflow function

Finally, you can use the `learn` interface to train the defined workflow function with a configuration file.

```python
from agentscope.learn import learn, LearnConfig

# your workflow function here...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    learn(
        workflow_func=workflow_function,
        config=LearnConfig.load_config("/path/to/your/config.yaml"),
    )
```

The trained model, training dataset, RL algorithm, training cluster and other configurations are all located in the configuration file, which should follow the Trinity-RFT configuration format.

See [config.yaml](./config.yaml) for an example configuration. For full configuration details, see [Trinity-RFT Configuration Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/Trinity-RFT/en/main/tutorial/trinity_configs.html).

    """

    return 1.0 if answer.strip() == truth.strip() else 0.0

    """Response structure for math tasks (simplified).
    This structure makes the agent's output easy to parse,
    allowing for easy reward calculation.
    """

    result: str = Field(description="Final answer to the math problem.")


async def react_workflow_function(task: Dict, model: TrinityChatModel) -> float:

    agent = ReActAgent(

        sys_prompt="You are a helpful math problem solving agent.",
        model=model,
        enable_meta_tool=True,
        formatter=OpenAIChatFormatter(),
    )

    response = await agent.reply(
        msg=Msg("user", task["question"], role="user"),
        structured_model=ResponseStructure,
    )

    reward = calculate_reward(response.metadata["result"], task["answer"])
    return reward

    learn(
        workflow_func=react_workflow_function,
        config=LearnConfig.load_config("/path/to/your/config.yaml"),
    )
