note that this example current is only compatible with claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 API, since other model could not even formulate the right equations for wolfram almpha API to solve.
also note that changing the temperature might affect the output since sometimes with a different temperature, the model could not properly adapt to the ReAct framework.
