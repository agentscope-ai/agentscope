- user agent: input idea and input feedback
- project manager agent: specify the requirements according to user's idea
- designer agent: generate design documents
- programmer agent: implement each module according to the design documents
- tester agent: test the software and provide feedback to the programmer agent

Progress:
1. User agent inputs an idea
2. Project manager agent extracts requirements according to the user's idea, and discusses with the user agent to confirm the requirements, finally generates a requirement list
3. Designer agent generates design documents according to the requirements
4. For each module in the design documents, programmer agent implements the module
5. Tester agent tests the software and provides feedback to the programmer agent
6. The programmer agent modifies the software according to the feedback
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the software is accepted by the tester agent
