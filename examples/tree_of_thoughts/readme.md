"This folder contains three examples showcasing interesting tasks and algorithms that can be completed using AgentScope. The goal of this example is to implement and compare three prompting strategiesâ€”ReAct for external services, Reflect-Improve for enhancing output quality, and Tree of Thoughts for boosting reasoning in large language models (LLMs).

 The main folder is 'notebooks,' which contains three runnable Jupyter notebooks:

- **react_example.ipynb** demonstrates how to equip the ReAct agent with a customized service, enabling it to complete tasks involving web searches, reasoning, and writing files to the computer.
- **complicated_flow.ipynb** illustrates how to build a reflection-improvement workflow using AgentScope to generate output with better quality.
- **tree_of_thoughts.ipynb** provides an implementation of the latest 'Tree of Thoughts' algorithm, which efficiently improves the capability of large language models to perform multi-step reasoning.

The other folders contain supplementary materials, and you can find more details within the corresponding notebooks."
