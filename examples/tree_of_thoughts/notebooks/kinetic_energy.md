The kinetic energy (KE) of an object can be calculated using the formula
$KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where 'm' is the mass of the object and 'v' is
its velocity.

To find the kinetic energy of LeBron James when running at the same
speed Usain Bolt achieved when setting the 100m world record, we first
need the mass of LeBron James and the speed of Usain Bolt.

LeBron James weighs 113 kg.

Usain Bolt's speed when he set the 100m world record was 37.58 km/h.
Converting this speed to m/s gives us approximately 10.44 m/s.

Plugging these values into the kinetic energy formula gives:

$KE = \frac{1}{2} (113 kg) (10.44 m/s)^2$

Therefore, the kinetic energy of LeBron James when running at this speed
would be approximately 6188.4 Joules.
