# Release Process

Releases in this repo are mostly automated using [release-plan](https://github.com/embroider-build/release-plan/). Once you label all your PRs correctly (see below) you will have an automatically generated PR that updates your CHANGELOG.md file and a `.release-plan.json` that is used to prepare the release once the PR is merged.

## Preparation

Since the majority of the actual release process is automated, the remaining tasks before releasing are:

- correctly labeling **all** pull requests that have been merged since the last release
- updating pull request titles so they make sense to our users

Some great information on why this is important can be found at [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), but the overall
guiding principle here is that changelogs are for humans, not machines.

When reviewing merged PR's the labels to be used are:

- breaking - Used when the PR is considered a breaking change.
- enhancement - Used when the PR adds a new feature or enhancement.
- bug - Used when the PR fixes a bug included in a previous release.
- documentation - Used when the PR adds or updates documentation.
- internal - Internal changes or things that don't fit in any other category.

**Note:** `release-plan` requires that **all** PRs are labeled. If a PR doesn't fit in a category it's fine to label it as `internal`

## Release

Once the prep work is completed, the actual release is straight forward: you just need to merge the open [Plan Release](https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-polyfill/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+%22Prepare+Release%22+in%3Atitle) PR
