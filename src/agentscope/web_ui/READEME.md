# AgentScope Running Time Web UI

A running-time interface for AgentScope, which is a tool for monitoring
the communication of agents in a multi-agent application.

## How to Use
To start a web UI, you can run the following python code:

```python
as_studio path/to/your/script.py
```
Remark: in `path/to/your/script.py`, there should be a `main` function.

## An Example

Run the following code in the root directory of this project after you
setup configs in `exampels/conversation/conversation.py`:
```python
as_studio exampels/conversation/conversation.py
```
The following interface will be launched at `localhost:7860`.
