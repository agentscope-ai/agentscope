### Workflow Pipeline

The workflow_pipeline consists of three main scenes:

1. **Run**: Execute the workflow.
2. **Compile**: Export the workflow to Python code.
3. **Optimize**: Enhance the workflow for better concurrency.

#### Quick Start

To get started quickly, you can run the following command:

```bash
python -m app.workflow_engine.as_workflow.pipeline_utils
```
