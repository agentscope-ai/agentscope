"""Agent-control tools exposed by the mem0 middleware.

These ``search_memory`` / ``add_memory`` tools are registered into the
agent's toolkit by :class:`Mem0Middleware` when ``mode`` is
``"agent_control"`` or ``"both"``. They close over the middleware
instance and the target agent so per-call ``user_id`` / ``agent_id``
resolvers keep working after registration.

Shape and behavior mirror AgentScope 1.x's
``Mem0LongTermMemory.retrieve_from_memory`` / ``record_to_memory``
(multi-keyword parallel search, 3-tier add fallback, verbose result
text) — adapted to AgentScope 2.x's tool conventions
(``FunctionTool`` wrapping plain async functions; failures return a
``ToolChunk`` with ``state=ERROR`` so the toolkit aggregates it
properly).
