# AgentScope Web UI

A user interface for AgentScope, which is a tool for monitoring and
analyzing the communication of agents in a multi-agent application.

## Quick Start
To start a web UI, you can run the following python code:

```python
import agentscope

agentscope.web.init(
    path_save="YOUR_SAVE_PATH",
    host="YOUR_WEB_IP",         # defaults to 127.0.0.1
    port=5000                   # defaults to 5000
)
```
The argument `path_save` refers to the saving directory of your application,
which defaults to `./runs` in AgentScope.

Note when running AgentScope applications, the argument `save_log` of
`agentscope.init` function should be `True` to enable saving the logging files.
```python
import agentscope

agentscope.init(
    # ...
    save_log=True,      # defaults to True
    # ...
)
```
## A Running Example

given saving path.
