### AgentScope V0.2.0 Roadmap

We are deeply grateful for the continuous support from the open-source community that has witnessed AgentScope's
growth. Throughout our journey, we have maintained **developer-centric transparency** as our core principle,
which will continue to guide our future development.

As the AI agent ecosystem rapidly evolves, we recognize the need to adapt AgentScope to meet emerging trends and
requirements. We are excited to announce the upcoming release of AgentScope v0.2.0, which marks a significant shift
towards deployment-oriented development. This new version will provide comprehensive support for agent developers
with enhanced deployment capabilities and practical features. Specifically, the update will include:

- Deployment-oriented
  - Comprehensive and native asynchronous execution
  - Automatic session/state management

- Developer-oriented
  - Production-level monitoring and tracing

- Advanced tools management
  - Stateful tools and toolkits management

- Agent-oriented evaluation
  - Extensive and effective evaluation framework for agents

Stay tuned for our detailed release notes and beta version, which will be available soon. Follow our GitHub
